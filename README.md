Project for Module 1 - Web Design &amp; Development 
# The project was inspired by my mother and her lack of having a cohesive interior design style. My website inspiration was Glossier, IKEA and urban outfitters. I wanted to create a website that had a quiz for styles and be a place where you can buy furniture as well.
